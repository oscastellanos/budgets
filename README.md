# Welcome to Budgets!

This is a simple web app that will be continually updated to add more features and options to customize a budget plan with a couple different financial goals in mind. 

# Current Deployment
As of June, 2019, the app is in beta version .2! This entails only options to add multiple revenue streams and expenses. The dashboard will provide quick numbers that will calculate how much money is left over per month and pie charts that visualize the categories you have defined. 


# Coming up.. 
More options, more specific types of expenses (credit cards, loans, etc.), the ability for a user to define financial goals and the best ways to achieve them (pay a credit card the quickest way, pay the minimum amount of interest across all credit cards, loans, etc.)
